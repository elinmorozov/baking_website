                        1/2 Cup of Coconut Oil - very cold and hard, (they will taste better with refined coconut oil)

                <ol class="food_item_ingredient">
                    <li>
                        Put a shallow bun tin or mince pie tin in the fridge to chill.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Add the flour, salt, coconut oil and sugar to a food processor and mix with a fork until it looks like breadcrumbs.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        
                        Add the water one tablespoon at a time until the dough just starts to ball up. Don't overwork the pastry because over working it will make the pastry tough.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Test that you can squeeze it together into a pliable dough. Add a tiny bit more water and process again if it's too dry. Then, bring the dough together and turn out onto a floured surface.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Roll out to 2-3mm thick and even all over.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Use a cookie cutter, mason jar lid or the top of a mug or glass to cut out circles from the dough and put it into the muffin tin.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Crimp the edges if you want to or just leave them.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Add a generous amount of mincemeat to each once. It should come right up level with the top.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Bring the pastry scraps back together and roll out again to 2 - 3 mm thick.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Cut out the lids. You can make them full round ones or cut them into shapes. Put the lid onto the open pies and press down all around to seal. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Brush the top of each pie with plant-based milk
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Refrigerate the pies while the oven warms up.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Once the oven is ready, remove the pies from the fridge and place in the hot oven.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Cook for around 30 minutes. The pastry should be turning golden brown and the mincemeat filling bubbling.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Remove from the oven and prise out gently.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Make sure they are cooled enough before sprinkling them with icing sugar.
                    </li>
