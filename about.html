           Hello, my name is Elin and I'm 13 years old.</br>
           Every holiday, I baked with my mum and we made lots of things like cookies, but we never tried to make anything more complicated like a cake.</br>
           During Lockdown, me and my mum wanted to cure our boredom by trying some new recipes, but it was challenging to get some
           of the necessary ingredients for our baking, such as sugar, flour, eggs and baking powder. My mum was lucky enough to get
           most of the ingredients we needed, but still no eggs. So we decided to try some recipes that don't require eggs.
           This is why we were looking for recipes that don't use eggs and that suits a lacto-free diet (but not for milk allergies.)</br>
           Soon enough, we got hooked on the idea and started to bake every Friday.</br>
           By the end of the summer, we had so many wonderful and delicious recipes, many from different countries and cultures
           such as German, Austrian, Eastern European, Indian and English. That's when I got the idea to make this website so that 
           everyone could enjoy our recipes. </br>
           I hope you enjoy these recipes as much as we do!
